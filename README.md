Overview
The Wellington Station project simulates a train network system for Wellington, focusing on managing train lines, stations, and train services. It allows users to interact with the system through a simple UI, providing functionalities like listing all stations, train lines, searching for stations or train lines, and more. This project is implemented in Java and serves as a practical application for understanding object-oriented programming concepts.

Features
List all train stations and train lines.
Search for specific train stations and train lines.
Display upcoming train lines for a specified station and time.
